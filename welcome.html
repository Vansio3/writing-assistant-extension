                <h2>Action Required: Set Up Your API Key</h2>
                <p>To start using the assistant, you need a free Google Gemini API key. This is required because the extension communicates directly between your browser and Google's AI, ensuring your privacy.</p>

                    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Best Practice</h3>
                    <p>
                        For your security, we **strongly recommend creating a new, restricted API key** specifically for this extension. An unrestricted key could potentially be used to access other Google Cloud services on your account. Restricting it ensures it can *only* be used for the Gemini AI model.
